## This artifact aims to apply for *Available* and *Functional* Badges.

* **Available:**
All the generated patches, the new benchmark HumanEval-Java proposed in the paper, as well as the fine-tuned code language models are all publicly avaiable. Thus, we believe the artifact deserves the Available Badge.

* **Functional:**
This artifact also includes the code and documents to reproduce all the results shown in RQ1 and RQ2 in the paper. Developers can also re-finetune the code language models by using our code. Lastly, the new APR benchmark HumanEval-Java can benefit furture works in automated program repair domain. Thus, we believe the artifact deserves the Functional Badge.
